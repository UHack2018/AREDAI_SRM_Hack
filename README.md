# The Lone Samurai

## Description
The main objective of our project is to present next generation of school students with a multipurpose educational tool which can be used ubiquitously in an educational environment. It consists of an Augmented Reality information display module with optional Immersive Virtual Reality display, powered by Image processing and Object Recognition. It also has the feature of detecting any pre-determined objects and getting information about the object. There is also an Optical Character Recognition which extracts text from the books and gets information about the text. It also includes a safe-search option by using certain keywords for blocking inappropriate content through the application. There is also a Chatbot module in the VR mode which enables the student to ask relevant doubts regarding subject. They can actually talk to the chatbot as we have used voice recognition as well.
